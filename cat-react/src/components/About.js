      <h1>Cute Animal Tending</h1>
      <p>Dedicated to the well-being of cute animals, the CAT leads and champions global efforts to give each and every cute animal, anywhere on the planet an equal chance to live a healthy life and be in caring hands.</p>
      <br></br>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1989, CAT is the United Nations agency that connects nations, partners and people to rescue cute animals, keep the world safe for them and serve the vulnerable – so every cute animal, everywhere can attain the highest level of health and care.
      As the world’s leading conservation organization, CAT works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.</p> 
      <br></br>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>CAT promotes healthier lives for the cute animals – from pregnancy care through old age. We lead shelters all around the world where we care for animals we rescued and ensure they will find a better home.</p>
      <br></br>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>We bear witness to the accelerating decline of nature and our climate, with serious consequences for life on Earth, including our own.
        <br></br>
        Our vision is to build a future in which people live in harmony with nature. To deliver this mission, we work to conserve and restore biodiversity, the web that supports all life on Earth; to reduce humanity’s environmental footprint; and to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources to support current and future generations.
        <br></br>
        We celebrate and respect diversity in nature and among the people, partners, and communities with whom we work. Across the many cultures and individuals that represent CAT, we are unified by one mission, one brand, and one common set of values:
        <br></br>
        <b>Courage</b>: We demonstrate courage through our actions, we work for change where it’s needed, and we inspire people and institutions to tackle the greatest threats to nature and the future of the planet, which is our home.<br></br>
        <b>Integrity</b>: We live the principles we call on others to meet. We act with integrity, accountability and transparency, and we rely on facts and science to guide us and to ensure we learn and evolve.<br></br>
        <b>Respect</b>: We honor the voices and knowledge of the people and communities that we serve, and we work to secure their rights to a sustainable future.<br></br>
        <b>Collaboration</b>: We deliver impact at the scale of the challenges we face through the power of collective action and innovation.</p>
      <br></br>

      <h2>Ethics</h2>
      <p>CAT is committed to a culture which allows people to safely raise concerns of inappropriate conduct by employees of CAT, its partners, and people associated with CAT, without fear of reprisals. Likewise, local communities or individuals from those communities who believe they are negatively impacted by CAT’s activities are welcome to send their concerns. Complaints may be submitted in the complainant’s native language, to the local CAT office or to our EthicsPoint reporting line.
      </p><br></br>

      <h2>Commitment To Integrity And Good Conduct
      </h2>
      <p>CAT commits to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and ethics in our workplace and in our activities. These commitments are fundamental to creating effective, lasting and equitable solutions to today’s environmental challenges.
      </p><br></br>

      <h2>Commitment To Independence</h2>
      <p>World Wildlife Fund, Inc. (CAT-US) is a U.S. public charity whose mission is to leverage sound science to conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth. We are an independent organization overseen by a Board of Directors with expertise in science, conservation, finance, and public policy, who volunteer their time and service.
      </p>
      <p>All actions, undertakings, and positions of CAT-US are determined by the organization alone. CAT does not operate as an agent or representative for any funder and does not accept funding from any source that could compromise our independence.
      </p>
      <p>CAT-US undertakes certain limited efforts to influence public policy to save nature, in furtherance of our mission and in accord with all applicable laws and regulations. CAT-US’s advocacy efforts are determined and undertaken independently, represent no party other than ourselves, and are fully disclosed as required.
      </p><br></br>


      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>For Nature, For People, Forever
        CAT works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability; and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.
        <br></br>CAT connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, more than 1.3 million supporters in the United States and 5 million globally, and our partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.
        <br></br>Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also humans who have the power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.</p>
